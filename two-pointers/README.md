# Two Pointers

This technique is used to iterate through a data set, typically an array or a list, in a controlled way using two pointers, one pointing to the begining and the other to the end of the dataset, and moving them towards each other based on desired conditions or patterns.

## Variants

- Left & Right Pointer (Approaching from both ends of Array)

- Slow & Fast Pointers: Using two pointers with different speed of movement. Typically they starts from the left end, then the first pointer advances fast and give some feedback to the slow pointer and do some calculation

- Merging 2 Arrays | Running from beginning of 2 Arrays

- Divide & conquer is similar to Split & Merge but there is one thing added. First, you need to split the given list into 2 separate lists and then do two pointers approach to merge or unify them.

## When to use

- Sorted arrays or lists where you need to find pairs that satisfy a specific condition
