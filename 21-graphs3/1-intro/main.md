# Shortest Path Algorithms Overview

## Introduction
Shortest path algorithms find the minimum distance or cost path between nodes in graphs. They are central in network routing, mapping, and resource optimization.

## Details
Common algorithms:

- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:** Works on graphs with non-negative weights.  
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Handles graphs with negative weights and detects negative cycles.  
- **A* Search:** Uses heuristics for informed pathfinding.

Shortest path computations enable efficient route planning and network analysis.

## Examples
Calculating shortest path from a source node to all others in a weighted graph.

## Key Concepts
- Graph weights represent costs or distances.  
- Algorithms use priority queues or dynamic programming.  
- Negative cycle detection is critical for correctness.

## Summary
Shortest path algorithms are fundamental for optimized traversal and decision-making in weighted graphs.
