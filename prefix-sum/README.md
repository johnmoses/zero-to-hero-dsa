# Prefix Sum

The prefix sum is a technique used to efficiently calculate the sum of all elements in an array up to a specified index. It is also known as cumulative sum, and it is often used in various computational problems such as range sum queries or dynamic programming

What it does is to  pre-compute the sum of all elements up to each index in the array and then use these pre-computed sums to quickly calculate the sum of any sub-array in the array.

It has time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), it is efficient and widely used in various computational problems such as range sum queries, dynamic programming and more.
