# Interval Algorithms

## Introduction

Interval algorithms focus on problems involving intervals or ranges, such as scheduling, merging, and querying overlapping intervals. They are essential for handling time or space-based problems where intervals play a key role.

## Details

These algorithms commonly address:

- Sorting intervals by start or end times.
- Merging overlapping intervals.
- Finding the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals (Interval Scheduling).
- Interval Trees and related data structures for advanced interval queries.

The approach often involves sorting intervals, greedy selection, and specialized data structures to perform queries efficiently.

## Examples

Common problems include:

- Merge Intervals: Combine all overlapping intervals into one.
- Interval Scheduling: Select the maximum number of mutually non-overlapping intervals.
- Meeting Rooms: Determine if a person can attend all meetings.
- Finding gaps or intersections in intervals.

## Key Concepts

- Sorting intervals as a preprocessing step.
- Greedy algorithms for optimal interval selection.
- Data structures like balanced trees or segment trees for dynamic queries.
- Handling edge cases such as touching intervals or zero-length intervals.

## Summary

Interval algorithms provide foundational techniques to efficiently solve a wide variety of problems involving intervals. Mastering these algorithms is key to tackling scheduling, timeline analysis, and range-query challenges.
