# Sweep Line Algorithms

## Introduction

Sweep Line Algorithms solve problems involving events distributed along one dimension, typically by sweeping a line across the plane or timeline and processing events in sorted order. They are powerful for solving geometric and interval-related problems efficiently.

## Details

The sweep line technique involves:

- Sorting events according to their coordinate (e.g., x-axis or time).
- Maintaining a data structure (often an ordered structure like a balanced tree) to track active events intersected by the sweep line.
- Processing start and end events to update the data structure and answer queries dynamically.

Applications are common in computational geometry, scheduling, and interval intersection problems.

## Examples

Typical problems solved by sweep line include:

- Finding intersections among intervals or line segments.
- Counting overlapping intervals.
- Computing skyline silhouette.
- Closest pair of points.

The algorithm reduces complex, n^2 comparisons to efficient n log n or better by clever event management.

## Key Concepts

- Event sorting and classification (start vs end).
- Dynamic tracking of active intervals or points.
- Data structures for efficient insertion, deletion, and query.
- Application to multidimensional geometric problems.

## Summary

Sweep line is a versatile algorithmic paradigm that transforms problems involving intervals and geometrical objects into manageable event-based processes, significantly improving efficiency through structured event handling.
