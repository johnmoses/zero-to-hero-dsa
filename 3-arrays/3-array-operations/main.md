# Array Operations

## Introduction
Array operations include common tasks like traversal, insertion, deletion, searching, and updating elements.

## Details
- **Traversal:** Accessing each element sequentially.
- **Insertion:** Adding elements at specific positions.
- **Deletion:** Removing elements by value or index.
- **Searching:** Finding the presence or index of an element.
- **Updating:** Changing the value of elements.

Understanding these operations enables effective use and manipulation of arrays in algorithms.

## Examples
Traversing an array to print all elements:

for element in array:
    print(element)

## Key Concepts
- Efficient traversal is essential.  
- Insertions/deletions are costly in fixed-size arrays.  
- Linear search checks elements sequentially.

## Summary
Mastering array operations is vital for utilizing arrays effectively in problem solving.
