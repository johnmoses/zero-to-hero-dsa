# Common Array Problems

## Introduction
Arrays are involved in many classical algorithmic problems such as finding maximum/minimum, sorting, searching, and subarray challenges.

## Details
Typical problems include:

- Finding the maximum or minimum element.
- Reversing an array.
- Finding subarrays with certain properties (e.g., maximum sum subarray).
- Searching for an element efficiently.
- Removing duplicates.

Understanding these problems and their solutions improves algorithmic thinking.

## Examples
Finding maximum element by traversal:

max_val = arr[0]  
for val in arr:  
    if val > max_val: max_val = val

## Key Concepts
- Use iterative approaches for linear problems.  
- Utilize sorting to simplify some problems.  
- Apply sliding window or two-pointer techniques for subarrays.

## Summary
Practicing common array problems builds a strong foundation for more advanced algorithm challenges.
