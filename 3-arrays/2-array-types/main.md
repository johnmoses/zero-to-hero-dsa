# Array Types

## Introduction
Arrays come in different variations designed for specific use cases, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and dynamic arrays.

## Details
- One-dimensional arrays store elements in a single line.
- Multi-dimensional arrays (2D, 3D, etc.) store elements in matrix-like structures.
- Dynamic arrays can resize during runtime (e.g., Python lists, C++ vectors).

Knowing the types aids selecting the appropriate array for the problem.

## Examples
A 2D array can represent a matrix:

[[1, 2],
 [3, 4]]

## Key Concepts
- One-dimensional arrays are simplest.  
- Multi-dimensional arrays extend to higher dimensions.  
- Dynamic arrays provide flexible sizing.

## One-dimensional arrays
One-dimensional arrays are linear collections of elements, accessible via a single index. They are ideal for simple lists of items.

## Multi-dimensional arrays
Multi-dimensional arrays extend the concept of one-dimensional arrays to multiple dimensions, allowing representation of complex data structures.

## Dynamic arrays
Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink in size as needed, providing flexibility in scenarios where the number of elements is not known in advance.

## Summary
Understanding array types expands your ability to model data in various forms.
