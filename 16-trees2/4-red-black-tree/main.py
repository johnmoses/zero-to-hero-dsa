# Red-Black Tree Node Example (Partial Implementation)

class RBNode:
    def __init__(self, key, color='red'):
        self.key = key
        self.color = color  # 'red' or 'black'
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None

# Full implementation includes insertion, deletion, rotations, and fixups
# This snippet defines the node and color properties as a starting point.
