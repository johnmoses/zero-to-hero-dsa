# Balancing and Rotations in Trees

## Introduction
Balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black involves tree rotations: operations that restructure nodes locally to restore balance.

## Details
- **Left Rotation:** Promotes right child and moves node down to left.  
- **Right Rotation:** Promotes left child and moves node down to right.

Rotations preserve binary search tree properties while reducing tree height and ensuring efficiency.

## Examples
Performing a left rotation to fix right-heavy unbalance.

## Key Concepts
- Rotations adjust tree structure.  
- Essential for self-balancing trees.  
- Maintain in-order traversal integrity.

## Summary
Tree rotations are fundamental operations to maintain balanced, efficient BSTs.
