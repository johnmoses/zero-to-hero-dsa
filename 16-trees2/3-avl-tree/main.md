# AVL Trees

## Introduction
AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees maintaining height balance for optimal operations.

## Details
The balance factor (height difference between left and right subtrees) is maintained at -1, 0, or 1.

Rotations (left, right, left-right, right-left) restore balance after insertions and deletions.

## Examples
After inserting nodes in AVL tree, rotations adjust structure to maintain balance.

## Key Concepts
- Height-balanced condition.  
- Rotations to maintain balance.  
- Ensures O(log n) height.

## Summary
AVL trees provide guaranteed performance through strict balancing.
