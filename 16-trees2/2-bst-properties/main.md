# Binary Search Tree (BST) Properties

## Introduction
BSTs maintain ordered structure properties allowing efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.

## Details
Keys in the left subtree are less than the nodeâ€™s key; keys in the right subtree are greater.

BST operations depend on tree height, with balanced trees ensuring optimal performance.

## Examples
In-order traversal of a BST produces sorted keys.

## Key Concepts
- Left subtree keys < node < right subtree keys.  
- BST supports O(log n) operations when balanced.  
- In-order traversal yields sorted data.

## Summary
BSTs provide foundational ordered data storage for efficient dynamic sets.
