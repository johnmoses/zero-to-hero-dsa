# Introduction to Advanced Trees

## Introduction
This chapter covers binary search trees (BSTs), balanced trees like AVL and Red-Black trees, and operations to maintain tree balance and efficiency.

## Details
Binary search trees organize elements to enable fast searching, insertion, and deletion.

Balanced trees guarantee O(log n) height, improving worst-case performance.

Tree rotations help maintain balanced tree structures.

## Examples
AVL trees automatically balance after insertions to guarantee height constraints.

## Key Concepts
- BST property: left < root < right.  
- Balancing ensures efficient operations.  
- Tree rotations restructure nodes without losing BST properties.

## Summary
Advanced trees optimize search and update times by maintaining balanced hierarchical structures.
