# Fast and Slow Pointers

## Introduction
The fast and slow pointers technique uses two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles and find midpoints in linked lists.

## Details
Fast pointer moves two steps at a time, slow pointer moves one. If a cycle exists, they will meet.

Use cases include detecting loops and locating middle nodes efficiently.

## Examples
Detect cycle in a linked list by checking if fast and slow pointers meet.

## Key Concepts
- Detect cycles efficiently in O(n) time and O(1) space.  
- Find midpoints for splitting lists.  
- Useful in many linked list problems.

## Summary
Fast and slow pointers is a classic technique for linked list problem-solving.
