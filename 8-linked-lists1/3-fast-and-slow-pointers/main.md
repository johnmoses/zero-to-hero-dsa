# Fast and Slow Pointers

## Introduction
The fast and slow pointers technique uses two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles and find midpoints in linked lists. It works by using two pointers that move through the data structure at different speeds. This difference in speed allows you to uncover information about the structure of the data, such as whether a linked list has a cycle.

## Details
Fast pointer moves two steps at a time, slow pointer moves one. If a cycle exists, they will meet.

Use cases include detecting loops and locating middle nodes efficiently.

## Common Applications

This pattern is particularly useful for:

1.  **Cycle Detection in a Linked List:** If a linked list has a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, there is no cycle.
2.  **Finding the Middle of a Linked List:** When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
3.  **Happy Number Problem:** The sequence of numbers generated by summing the squares of digits can be treated as a linked list. If there is a cycle, the number is not a happy number.
4.  **Finding the Duplicate Number:** In an array where numbers are in a certain range, you can treat the array as a linked list and use cycle detection to find a duplicate number.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is typically **O(N)**, where N is the number of elements in the data structure. This is because, in the worst case, each element is visited a constant number of times by the slow and fast pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(1)** because the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.

## Examples
Detect cycle in a linked list by checking if fast and slow pointers meet.

## Key Concepts
- Detect cycles efficiently in O(n) time and O(1) space.  
- Find midpoints for splitting lists.  
- Useful in many linked list problems.

## Summary
Fast and slow pointers is a classic technique for linked list problem-solving.
