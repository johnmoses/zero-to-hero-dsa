# Singly Linked List Structure

## Introduction
A singly linked list is a collection of nodes arranged sequentially, where each node points to the next, ending with a null reference.

## Details
Each node contains:

- Data element  
- A pointer/reference to the next node

Operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal. Efficient for dynamic lists but only traversable in one direction.

## Examples
Inserting a new node at the beginning involves adjusting head reference.

## Key Concepts
- Nodes linked forward only.  
- Head points to the first node.  
- Supports linear traversal.

## Summary
Singly linked lists are simple yet powerful for dynamic data representations needing sequential access.
