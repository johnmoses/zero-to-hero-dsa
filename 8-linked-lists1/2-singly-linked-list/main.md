# Singly Linked List Structure

## Introduction
A singly linked list is a collection of nodes arranged sequentially, where each node points to the next, ending with a null reference.

## Details
Each node contains:

- Data element  
- A pointer/reference to the next node

Operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal. Efficient for dynamic lists but only traversable in one direction.

Insertion:
At the Beginning: Create a new node, set its next pointer to the current head, and update the head to point to the new node.
At the End: Traverse to the last node, set its next pointer to the new node.

- At a Specific Index: Traverse to the node before the desired index, update pointers to insert the new node in between.

Deletion:

- At the Beginning: Update the head to point to the second node.
- At the End: Traverse to the second-to-last node, update its next pointer to None.
- At a Specific Index: Traverse to the node before the desired index, update pointers to remove the node at the specified index.

Search:
Traverse the list, comparing each node's data with the target value until found or the end is reached.

## Examples
Inserting a new node at the beginning involves adjusting head reference.

## Key Concepts
- Nodes linked forward only.  
- Head points to the first node.  
- Supports linear traversal.

## Summary
Singly linked lists are simple yet powerful for dynamic data representations needing sequential access.
