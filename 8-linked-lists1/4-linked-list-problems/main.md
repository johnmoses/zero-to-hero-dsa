# 4 Linked List Problems

# Linked List Problems

## Introduction
This topic explores common linked list problems involving traversal, insertion, deletion, cycle detection, and reversal.

## Details
Problems include:

- Reversing a linked list.  
- Detecting and removing cycles.  
- Finding nth node from the end.  
- Merging two sorted linked lists.

Solving these prepares you for complex linked list challenges.

## Examples
Reversing a singly linked list by changing pointers.
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Merge k Sorted Lists

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

## Key Concepts
- Manipulate pointers carefully.  
- Use fast and slow pointers as needed.  
- Practice foundational problems for mastery.

## Summary
Mastery of classic linked list problems builds strong data structure and algorithm skills.
