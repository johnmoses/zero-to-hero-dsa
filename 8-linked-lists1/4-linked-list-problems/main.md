# 4 Linked List Problems

# Linked List Problems

## Introduction
This topic explores common linked list problems involving traversal, insertion, deletion, cycle detection, and reversal.

## Details
Problems include:

- Reversing a linked list.  
- Detecting and removing cycles.  
- Finding nth node from the end.  
- Merging two sorted linked lists.

Solving these prepares you for complex linked list challenges.

## Examples
Reversing a singly linked list by changing pointers.

## Key Concepts
- Manipulate pointers carefully.  
- Use fast and slow pointers as needed.  
- Practice foundational problems for mastery.

## Summary
Mastery of classic linked list problems builds strong data structure and algorithm skills.
