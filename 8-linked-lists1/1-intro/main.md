# Introduction to Linked Lists

## Introduction
Linked Lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. It is an alternative data structure to array-based sequences.

## Details
Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion without shifting elements.

Types of linked lists include singly linked, doubly linked, and circular linked lists. Understanding linked lists is foundational for complex data structures and algorithms.

## Examples
A singly linked list node contains:

- Data value  
- Reference to the next node

## Key Concepts
- Dynamic size and efficient insertions/deletions.  
- Nodes connected by pointers or references.  
- Different types provide different capabilities.

## Summary
Linked lists offer flexible storage compared to arrays and form the basis for many advanced structures.
