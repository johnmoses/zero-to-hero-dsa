# Queues

A queue is collection of objects that are inserted or removed according to first-in, first-out(FIFO) principle. It is a fundamental data structure. A functional or real world example is people waiting at a train station to get tickets for their trips. It can be called first-come, first-serve.
We see queues in real life at gas stations, counters, reservation centers, stores, theatres.

Queue abstract data type (ADT) supports enqueue and dequeue operations. Enqueue adds element to the back of the queue while dequeue removes the first element at the front and returns first element.

Other methods are `first(), is_empty(), len(Q)`.

## Priority queues

This is a special type of queues that has a slight departure from the reqular queue policy. Here some very important exceptions are acommodated for insertion or removal of elements from the queues.

## Array Queue

This is an array-based queue implementation

## Deque Queues

This is a `deque()` implementation of a queue

## Linked List Queues

This uses linked list for queue implementation

## Heaped Queues

This a queue based on a tree data structure. It is an improvement over priority queue that achieves a faster and more efficient data structure.

There are many ways of creating queues, popular ones include array, queues, deque queues, and linked list queues
