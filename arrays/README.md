# Arrays

## What Is an Array?

An Array is a collection or sequence of homogeneous items or elements that can be accesed or replaced at given index positions. In other words it is a group of related items that can be stored one after another in a contiguous portion of the computer's memory. The items could be single or multiple values of variables like integers, strings, DVDs, games, books, anything. An array uses Python's list to hold data.

## Types of arrays

Types of arrays include low level, referential, compact, dynamic arrays.

## Array length and capacity

Array length is the number of items an array currently holds while array capacity is the total number of items the array is designed to hold in the array definition. This is common in Java programming.

## Basic Array operations

- Insert
- Delete
