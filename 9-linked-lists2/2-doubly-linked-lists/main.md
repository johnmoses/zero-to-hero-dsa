# Doubly Linked Lists

## Introduction
A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains data and pointers to both the previous and next node.

## Details
It supports bidirectional traversal, making some operations like deletion easier compared to singly linked lists.

Operations include insertion and deletion at head, tail, or any position, with careful pointer updates.

## Examples
Deleting a node requires updating both neighbors' pointers.

## Key Concepts
- Each node has two pointers (prev and next).  
- Head and tail pointers are maintained.  
- Supports forward and backward traversal.

## Summary
Doubly linked lists provide flexibility in traversal and efficient modification at both ends.
