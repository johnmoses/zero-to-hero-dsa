# Circular Linked Lists

## Introduction
Circular linked lists are linked lists where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

## Details
They can be singly or doubly linked. Circular lists allow continuous traversal starting at any node.

Use cases include buffering and round-robin scheduling.

## Examples
In a circular singly linked list, traversal stops when the pointer returns to the start node.

## Key Concepts
- Last node links to first node.  
- Supports infinite looping through nodes.  
- Useful in cyclic operations.

## Summary
Circular linked lists provide natural cyclic data structure useful in many algorithms.
