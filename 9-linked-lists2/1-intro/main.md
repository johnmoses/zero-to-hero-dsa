# Introduction to Advanced Linked Lists

## Introduction
This chapter introduces advanced variations of linked lists beyond the singly linked list, including doubly and circular linked lists.

## Details
Doubly linked lists add backward links, enabling bidirectional traversal. Circular linked lists connect the last node back to the first, forming a loop.

These structures support more complex operations and are useful in various applications like navigation and resource management.

## Examples
Doubly linked list node includes pointers to previous and next nodes.

## Key Concepts
- Doubly linked list supports forward and backward traversal.  
- Circular linked lists form a closed loop.  
- Enhanced flexibility compared to singly linked lists.

## Summary
Advanced linked list types expand your toolkit for building efficient data structures.
