# Complex Linked List Manipulations

## Introduction
This topic explores advanced linked list operations like reversing doubly linked lists, detecting & removing cycles, and merging lists.

## Details
Operations include:

- Reversing singly and doubly linked lists.  
- Removing cycles by fixing pointers.  
- Merging two sorted linked lists efficiently.

These skills help manage complex data structures and algorithms.

## Examples
Reversing a doubly linked list changes both next and prev pointers.

## Key Concepts
- Careful pointer handling required.  
- Combination of traversal and pointer updates.  
- Important for real-world linked list tasks.

## Summary
Mastering complex manipulations enables robust and optimized linked list implementations.
