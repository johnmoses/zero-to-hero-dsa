# Stack Operations

## Introduction
Stacks support fundamental operations such as push, pop, peek (top), and isEmpty.

## Details
- **Push:** Add element to the top.  
- **Pop:** Remove element from the top.  
- **Peek/Top:** View the element at the top without removing it.  
- **isEmpty:** Check if stack is empty.

Efficient for recursive algorithms, parsing, and backtracking.

## Examples
Using stack to reverse a string.

## Key Concepts
- LIFO principle governs stack behavior.  
- Constant time operations.  
- Simple implementation using arrays or linked lists.

## Summary
Stacks provide a last-in-first-out data structure essential in many algorithmic contexts.
