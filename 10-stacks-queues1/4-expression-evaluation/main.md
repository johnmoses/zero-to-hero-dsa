# Expression Evaluation

## Introduction
Expression evaluation involves using stacks to parse and compute arithmetic expressions, manage operator precedence, and convert between notations.

## Details
Stacks assist in implementing algorithms for infix to postfix conversion, postfix evaluation, and handling parentheses.

This technique is fundamental in compilers, calculators, and interpreters.

## Examples
Evaluating postfix expressions using a stack.

## Key Concepts
- Use stack to hold operators or operands.  
- Manage operator precedence and parentheses.  
- Evaluate expressions in single pass.

## Summary
Stack-based expression evaluation is a core algorithm in parsing and calculation tasks.
