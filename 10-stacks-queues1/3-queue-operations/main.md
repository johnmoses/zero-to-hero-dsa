# Queue Operations

## Introduction
Queues support operations including enqueue, dequeue, front (peek), and isEmpty.

## Details
- **Enqueue:** Add element at the rear.  
- **Dequeue:** Remove element from the front.  
- **Front/Peek:** Access the front element without removing.  
- **isEmpty:** Check if queue is empty.

Used in task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search.

## Examples
Simulate a printer queue managing jobs in order.

## Key Concepts
- FIFO principle dictates queue behavior.  
- Operations run in constant time.  
- Implementable via arrays, linked lists, or deque.

## Summary
Queues provide orderly processing with first-in-first-out behavior essential in many algorithms.
