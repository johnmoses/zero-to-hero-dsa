# Introduction to Stacks and Queues

## Introduction
Stacks and queues are fundamental linear data structures used to store and manage collections of elements in specific orders.

## Details
- **Stack:** Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure, elements added and removed from the top.  
- **Queue:** First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure, elements added at rear and removed from front.

Stacks are used in expression evaluation and backtracking; queues in buffering and scheduling.

## Examples
Stack usage: Undo functionality.  
Queue usage: Printer jobs scheduling.

## Key Concepts
- Different rules for element insertion and removal.  
- Both support dynamic sizes.  
- Implementable via arrays or linked lists.

## Summary
Stacks and queues provide structured ways to manage data flow and support various algorithms.
