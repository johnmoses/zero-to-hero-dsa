""" 
Find the next greater element for each element in an array. Output -1 if the greater element doesnâ€™t exist.

Example:
Input: nums = [2, 1, 2, 4, 3]
Output: [4, 2, 4, -1, -1]

Explanation:
Use a stack to keep track of elements for which we havenâ€™t found the next greater element yet.
Iterate through the array, and for each element, pop elements from the stack until you find a greater element.
If the stack is not empty, set the result for index at the top of the stack to current element.
Push the current element onto the stack.
