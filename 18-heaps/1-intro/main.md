# Introduction to Heaps

## Introduction
Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures satisfying the heap property: in a max heap, parent nodes are greater than or equal to their children; in a min heap, less than or equal.

## Details
Heaps are commonly implemented as binary heaps using arrays for efficient access.

They support priority queue operations where the highest (or lowest) priority element is accessible in constant time.

## Examples
Min heap stores the smallest element at the root, facilitating efficient extraction.

## Key Concepts
- Binary heap uses array-based representation.  
- Efficient insert and extract operations.  
- Useful for priority queues and heap sort.

## Summary
Heaps optimize access to highest or lowest elements efficiently in dynamic data sets.
