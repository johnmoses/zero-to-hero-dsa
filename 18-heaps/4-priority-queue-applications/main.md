# Priority Queue Applications

## Introduction
Priority queues use heap structures to manage ordered elements allowing fast access to the highest or lowest priority item.

## Details
Common applications include:

- **Heap Sort:** Uses a heap to sort elements efficiently in O(n log n).  
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:** Utilizes min-heaps for shortest path computations.  
- **Huffman Coding:** Builds optimal prefix codes using priority queues.

Priority queues underpin many practical algorithms where dynamic priority ordering is needed.

## Examples
Heap sort builds a max heap and extracts maximum elements iteratively to sort the array.

## Key Concepts
- Priority queues provide efficient priority-based operations.  
- Heap data structure enables logarithmic insertion and extraction.  
- Widely used in graph algorithms and compression schemes.

## Summary
Priority queues empower a broad range of algorithms by efficiently managing ordered data.
