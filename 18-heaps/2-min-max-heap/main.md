# Min and Max Heaps

## Introduction
Min heaps keep the smallest element at the root, max heaps keep the largest.

## Details
Insertion and extraction adjust the heap using sift-up or sift-down operations to maintain heap property.

Max heaps implement priority queues for largest-first access; min heaps for smallest-first access.

## Examples
Inserting elements while maintaining min heap structure.

## Key Concepts
- Heap property ensures root is min or max.  
- Array-based implementation is efficient.  
- Balancing operations maintain heap after updates.

## Summary
Min and max heaps provide structured priority access suitable for dynamic sets.
