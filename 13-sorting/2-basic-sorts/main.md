# Basic Sorting Algorithms

## Introduction
Basic sorting algorithms include simple, intuitive methods like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## Details
These algorithms have average and worst-case time complexities of O(nÂ²), making them inefficient for large datasets but suitable for educational purposes and small arrays.

## Examples
Bubble sort repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## Key Concepts
- Simple implementation and understanding.  
- Inefficient for large data sets.  
- Useful as building blocks for advanced algorithms.

## Summary
Mastering basic sorts provides foundational understanding of sorting mechanics and algorithm design.
