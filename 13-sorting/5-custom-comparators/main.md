# Sorting with Custom Comparators

## Introduction
Custom comparators allow sorting based on user-defined criteria beyond natural ordering.

They are crucial when sorting complex objects or multi-field sorting.

## Examples
Sorting a list of students by grade descending, then name ascending.

## Key Concepts
- Custom comparison logic.  
- Enables sorting of complex data types.  
- Supports multi-level sorting.

## Summary
Custom comparators provide flexible sorting tailored to specific application requirements.
