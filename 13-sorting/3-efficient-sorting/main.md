# Efficient Sorting Algorithms

## Introduction
Efficient sorting algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, employing divide-and-conquer or data structure techniques.

## Details
These algorithms have better time complexity, typically O(n log n), suitable for large datasets.

Merge Sort divides arrays and merges sorted subarrays; Quick Sort partitions based on pivots; Heap Sort uses heap data structure properties.

## Examples
Merge sort recursively divides and merges sorted arrays.

## Key Concepts
- Divide and conquer principle.  
- Recursive implementations common.  
- Stable or unstable depending on algorithm.

## Summary
Efficient sorts enable high-performance sorting for large, complex data.
