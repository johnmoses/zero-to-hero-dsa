# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

## Introduction
Analyzing sorting algorithms involves studying their time complexity, space complexity, and stability.

## Details
- **Time complexity:** Best, worst, and average case performance (e.g., O(nÂ²) for bubble sort, O(n log n) for merge sort).  
- **Space complexity:** Extra memory needed (in-place vs. not).  
- **Stability:** Whether equal elements maintain their original order.

Understanding these helps select the best sorting algorithm for given scenarios.

## Examples
Merge sort is stable and has O(n log n) time but needs extra space.

## Key Concepts
- Trade-offs between speed and memory.  
- Algorithmic stability important for some applications.  
- Best and worst cases vary with data conditions.

## Summary
Sorting analysis guides algorithm choice and performance expectations.
