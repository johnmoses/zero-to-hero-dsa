""" 
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. 
The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.

Sample 1:
    list1 = [1,2,4]
    list2 = [1,3,4]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
