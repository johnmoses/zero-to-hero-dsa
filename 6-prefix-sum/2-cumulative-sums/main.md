# Cumulative Sums

## Introduction
Cumulative sums extend the prefix sum concept to multiple kinds of cumulative computations.

## Details
Besides sums, cumulative products, counts, or other aggregates can be efficiently calculated similarly by preprocessing.

Cumulative sums help with frequent range queries.

## Examples
Cumulative count of positive numbers up to each index.

## Key Concepts
- Generalization of prefix sums.  
- Supports various aggregations.  
- Enables efficient range queries.

## Summary
Cumulative sums generalize prefix sums to multiple aggregations facilitating efficient range operations.
