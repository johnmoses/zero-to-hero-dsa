# Introduction to Matrices

## Introduction
Matrices or grids are two-dimensional arrays representing data arranged in rows and columns. They are foundational in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. Matrices allow for efficient storage and manipulation of data in a structured format.

## Details
Matrices support various operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition. They are used in graphics, data representation, and solving systems of equations.

Understanding matrix structure and basic operations is fundamental for many algorithms.

## Representation

The cell a[0] [0] is the first element of the first row and first column. The value in the first square bracket represents the row number and the value inside the second square bracket represents the column number. (i.e, a[row] [column]).

The rows are horizontal while columns are vertical in orientation.

## Traversal

Matrix Traversal involves traversing elements in a matrix using different techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.).

Use this pattern for problems involving traversing 2D grids or matrices horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## Examples
A 3x3 matrix:

[[1, 2, 3],  
 [4, 5, 6],  
 [7, 8, 9]]

## Key Concepts
- Rectangular grid of elements.  
- Indexed by row and column.  
- Support arithmetic and linear algebra operations.

## Summary
Mastering matrices enables effective handling of multidimensional data and problem solving in numerous applications.
