# Introduction to Matrices

## Introduction
Matrices are two-dimensional arrays representing data arranged in rows and columns. They are foundational in mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

## Details
Matrices support various operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition. They are used in graphics, data representation, and solving systems of equations.

Understanding matrix structure and basic operations is fundamental for many algorithms.

## Examples
A 3x3 matrix:

[[1, 2, 3],  
 [4, 5, 6],  
 [7, 8, 9]]

## Key Concepts
- Rectangular grid of elements.  
- Indexed by row and column.  
- Support arithmetic and linear algebra operations.

## Summary
Mastering matrices enables effective handling of multidimensional data and problem solving in numerous applications.
