# Matrix Operations

## Introduction
This topic introduces common operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition of matrices.

## Details
- Addition and subtraction require matrices of same dimensions.  
- Multiplication involves dot products and requires compatible dimensions.  
- Transposition flips rows and columns.

Operations are building blocks of linear algebra applications.

## Examples
Multiplying two matrices of compatible sizes.

## Key Concepts
- Dimension compatibility.  
- Element-wise and aggregate operations.  
- Transpose swaps dimensions.

## Summary
Mastering matrix operations is vital for applying matrices in computations and problem solving.
