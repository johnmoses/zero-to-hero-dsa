# Matrix Basics

## Introduction
This topic covers basic properties and representation of matrices.

## Details
Matrices have dimensions: rows and columns. The element position is given by indices (row, column).

Common types include square, rectangular, diagonal, identity matrices.

Understanding layout is key for processing and algorithms.

## Examples
An identity matrix of size 3x3:

[[1, 0, 0],  
 [0, 1, 0],  
 [0, 0, 1]]

## Key Concepts
- Dimensions define size.  
- Indexing elements efficiently.  
- Recognizing special matrices.

## Summary
Basic knowledge of matrix structure supports effective manipulation and algorithm design.
