# Matrix Traversal and Search

## Introduction
Traversal and search in matrices involve systematically accessing each element, often to find values or patterns.

## Details
Common traversal orders:

- Row-major: traverse row by row.  
- Column-major: traverse column by column.

Search methods depend on matrix properties, such as sorted rows/columns.

## Examples
Searching for a value in a sorted matrix using optimized methods.

## Key Concepts
- Consistent traversal patterns.  
- Using matrix properties to optimize search.

## Summary
Efficient traversal and search enhance performance in matrix-based problems.
