# Matrix Problems

## Introduction
Matrix problems involve applying matrix operations and traversal techniques to solve classical and advanced challenges.

## Details
Typical problems include:

- Finding the largest rectangle of 1s in a binary matrix.  
- Spiral traversal of a matrix.  
- Rotating a matrix by 90 degrees.  
- Pathfinding in grids.

Solving these problems develops deeper understanding of matrix manipulation.

## Examples
Rotating a square matrix in-place.

## Key Concepts
- Use traversal strategies.  
- Apply transformations carefully.  
- Handle edge cases in boundaries.

## Summary
Matrix problems improve your ability to manipulate and reason about 2D data structures effectively.
