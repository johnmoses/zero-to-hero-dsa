# Dynamic Programming and Linear Algebra Applications

## Introduction
Matrices play key roles in dynamic programming and linear algebra, enhancing solutions for complex problems.

## Details
In dynamic programming, 2D DP tables represent states often modeled as matrices.

In linear algebra, matrices enable transformations, eigenvalue problems, and solving systems of equations.

Applications include shortest path algorithms, image processing, and machine learning.

## Examples
DP matrix for computing edit distance between strings.

## Key Concepts
- Matrices store state information in DP.  
- Linear algebra uses matrices for transformations.  
- Matrix operations underpin advanced algorithms.

## Summary
Combining matrix knowledge with other fields unlocks enhanced problem-solving capabilities in technology.
