# Introduction to Programming

## Introduction
Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks. It forms the foundation for building software applications and solving computational problems.

## Details
Programming involves writing code using programming languages to communicate with computers. It requires understanding algorithms, data structures, and control logic to create efficient and effective solutions.

Key elements include writing syntax-correct statements, debugging errors, and organizing code into understandable structures like functions and classes.

## Examples
A simple example is printing a greeting:

print("Hello, World!")  # Python

System.out.println("Hello, World!");  // Java

std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;  // C++

## Key Concepts
- Programming languages enable communication with computers.  
- Syntax is the set of rules governing code structure.  
- Algorithms solve problems step-by-step.  
- Debugging identifies and fixes errors.


## Data Structures

A data structure is a way to store data.

## Types of data structures

There are two basic categories of data structures namely, linear and non-linear Data Structures

## Linear Data Structures

These are sequential data structures. They include:

1. Arrays
2. Hashes
3. Linked Lists
4. Queues
5. Stacks

## Non-linear Data Structures

These are non-sequential data structures. They include:

1. Trees
2. Graphs
3. Matrices

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.

An algorithm is a structured set of instructions designed to solve a problem or perform a computation. It operates by taking an input, processing it through a sequence of defined steps, and producing an output. Algorithms are fundamental in computer science, mathematics, and everyday tasks, serving as the backbone for data processing, calculations, and decision-making systems.

Key Features of Algorithms

 1. Finite Steps: Every algorithm consists of a finite number of steps that must be followed in a specific order.
 2. Input and Output: Algorithms require input data to process and produce output results.
 3. Deterministic or Randomized: While most algorithms follow deterministic steps, some incorporate randomness for certain computations.
 4. Automation: Algorithms can be executed manually or automatically by machines.

Applications

 1. Search Engines: Algorithms retrieve relevant information based on user queries.
 2. Social Media: They prioritize content in feeds based on user behavior and engagement.
 3. Navigation Systems: Algorithms calculate the most efficient routes between locations.
 4. Artificial Intelligence: Advanced algorithms enable systems to learn from data and make decisions autonomously.
In essence, algorithms are logical frameworks that guide problem-solving across various domains, ensuring efficiency and consistency in achieving desired outcomes.
