# Control Flow

## Introduction
Control flow directs the order in which instructions in a program are executed, allowing the program to make decisions and repeat actions.

## Details
Control flow is managed using conditional statements and loops. Conditional statements execute code based on conditions, while loops repeat code blocks multiple times.

Key constructs include:

- if, else if (elif), else  
- for loops  
- while loops  
- break and continue statements to control loop execution

These constructs enable dynamic behavior in programs depending on inputs or internal state.

## Examples
Basic use of control flow:

# Python
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

## Key Concepts
- Conditional execution chooses code paths.  
- Loops repeat actions while conditions hold.  
- Control statements alter loop flow (break, continue).

## Summary
Control flow enables programs to respond to different scenarios and perform repetitive tasks, making programs flexible and powerful.
