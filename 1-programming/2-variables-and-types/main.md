# Variables and Data Types

## Introduction
Variables are the fundamental building blocks in programming that allow you to store and manipulate data. Understanding variables and data types is essential for writing meaningful and efficient code.

## Details
A *variable* is a named location in memory where data can be stored. Each variable has a *data type* which determines the kind of data it can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, text, or boolean values.

Variables must be declared before use (in some languages), and can be assigned values. The type of a variable defines the operations that can be performed on it and the amount of memory it occupies.

Common data types include:  
- Integer: Whole numbers without fractions.  
- Floating-point: Numbers with fractional parts.  
- Character: A single letter or symbol.  
- Boolean: Represents truth values (true or false).  
- String: A sequence of characters representing text.

Type conversion allows variables to change their type through explicit casting or implicit coercion.

## Examples
Here is a simple example of declaring variables with different types and assigning values:

# Python
age = 25                       # integer
pi = 3.14159                   # floating-point
name = "Alice"                 # string
is_active = True               # boolean

The same concept applies in C++ and Java with slightly different syntax and explicit type declarations.

## Key Concepts
- Variables store data for use in programs.  
- Data types define the nature of the data a variable can hold.  
- Variables must often be declared with their type before use.  
- Type conversion changes data types between variables.

## Summary
Mastering variables and data types is crucial as they form the basis of all data manipulation in programming. Different programming languages offer various types and ways to use them, but the concepts remain consistent across languages.
