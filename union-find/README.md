# Union Find

Union-Find, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is a data structure and algorithm used to efficiently manage disjoint sets and perform operations such as union and find.

It is important to learn the basics of recursion and depth first search before going into this algorithm.

## Typical scenarios and operations in Union-Find

- Merging two disjoint sets to a single set using Union operation.
- Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
- Check if two elements belong to same set or not. We mainly find representative of both and check if same.
