# String Searching

## Introduction
String searching involves finding occurrences of a substring within a larger string. Itâ€™s fundamental in text processing.

## Details
Basic methods include:

- **Naive search:** Check each position for a match.
- **Built-in functions:** Languages offer optimized search utilities.
- **Advanced algorithms:** KMP, Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore for efficiency.

Efficiency matters for large texts or numerous searches.

## Examples
Searching "world" in "Hello, world!" returns index 7.

## Key Concepts
- Searching can be direct or algorithmic.  
- Built-in methods are often sufficient and optimized.  
- Advanced algorithms improve worst-case performance.

## Summary
Understanding string searching enables efficient text analysis and data retrieval.
