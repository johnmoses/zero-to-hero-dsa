# Introduction to Strings

## Introduction
Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text in programming. They are one of the most common data types.

## Details
Strings are immutable in some languages (e.g., Java, Python), meaning they cannot be changed once created. Others (like C++) allow mutable strings.

Operations on strings include concatenation, slicing, searching, and formatting. Strings can store letters, digits, symbols, and whitespace.

## Examples
Example: "Hello, World!" is a string literal.

## Key Concepts
- Strings represent text data.  
- Can be mutable or immutable depending on language.  
- Support common operations like concatenation and slicing.

## Summary
Understanding strings and their behaviors is essential for text processing and manipulation in programming.
