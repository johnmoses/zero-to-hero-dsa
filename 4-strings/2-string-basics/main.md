# String Basics

## Introduction
This topic introduces basic string concepts including creation, length, indexing, and common operations.

## Details
Strings can be created as literals or using constructors. Length of a string determines how many characters it contains. Indexing allows access to individual characters.

Common operations: concatenation, searching (finding substrings), changing case, trimming whitespace.

## Examples
Getting length:

len("hello") → 5

Access first character:

"hello"[0] → 'h'

## Key Concepts
- Strings support length and indexing.  
- Common operations include concatenation, search, and manipulation.  
- Indexing usually starts at 0.

## Summary
Basic string operations are building blocks for more complex string handling and text processing.
