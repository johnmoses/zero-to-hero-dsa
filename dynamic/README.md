# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and solving them using a bottom-up or top-down approach.

## Sub patterns

Fibonacci Numbers
0/1 Knapsack
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Subset Sum
Matrix Chain Multiplication

## When to use

Use this pattern for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

## Problems

Climbing Stairs (LeetCode #70)
House Robber (LeetCode #198)
Coin Change (LeetCode #322)
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) (LeetCode #1143)
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) (LeetCode #322)
Partition Equal Subset Sum (LeetCode #416)
