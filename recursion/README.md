# Recursion

Recursion is a problem solving approach or technique where a function calls itself within the function definition.

## Components of a recursive algorithm

A recursive algorithm has two basic parts namely:

1. A base case or cases. This does not use recursion
2. A set of rules or recurrent relation for evaluation based on base case
