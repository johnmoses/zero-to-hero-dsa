# Binary Search

Bimary search algorithm is one of the most efficient search algorithms in computing. The algorithms itself is made up of the folliwing components:

- Target: search value or parameter
- Index: current location
- Left, right, start, end, low, high: indices of the search space
- Mid: index of search condition

## Parts of efficient binary search algorithms

Efficient binary search algorithms are typically composed of three parts:

1. Pre-processing to do a sort if collection is unsorted
2. Searching with loop or recursion to divide search space into two after each comparison
3. Post-processing to determine viable candidates in the remaining search space

## Binary Search Patterns

Looking at binary search coding patterns, three templates can be deduced. This includes basic, advanced and professional patterns
