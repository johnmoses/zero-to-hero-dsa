# Getting Started with Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary search tree (BST), a special form of a binary tree, satisfies the binary search property:

- The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values stored in its left subtree.
- The value in each node must be less than (or equal to) any values stored in its right subtree.

Binary Search Trees is that operations like search, delete, and insert are fast and done without having to shift values in memory.
