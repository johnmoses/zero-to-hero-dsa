# Greedy Programming

A greedy algorithm is a type of technique or approach that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In other words, at each step, it chooses the option that seems the best at that moment without considering the potential impact of the decision on future steps.

Greedy programming is mainly used for optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of possibilities. The solutions are constructed incrementally, with the algorithm making the locally optimal choice at each stage.
