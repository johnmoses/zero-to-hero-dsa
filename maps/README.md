# Maps

Python's `dict` class has an abstraction called `dictionary` in which unique keys are mapped to associated values. This is why a dictionaries are sometimes called associative arrays or maps. For example, we can map letters of the alphabets to numbers. There are five basic behaviours to start with, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__len__`, `__iter__` and  `__delitem__`.

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of elements, without duplicates, that typically supports efficient membership tests. Unlike maps, elements in a set do not have auxilary values, they are jusk keys.

## Multimaps

A multimap is a map when same key can be mapped to multiple values.

## Multisets

A multiset is a set that allows duplicate values
