- Cultivate effective communication skills to explain your thought processes.
- Understand how to handle unexpected challenges and questions gracefully.

## Preparation Approach

### Structured Practice

- Focus on mastering foundational data structures and algorithms.
- Practice a diverse set of problems, progressively increasing in difficulty.
- Use mock interviews to simulate real interview conditions.
- Review mistakes thoroughly and understand alternative solutions.

### Problem Solving Technique

- **Clarify Requirements:** Ensure you understand the problem statement and constraints.
- **Plan Before Coding:** Outline your approach and discuss it with the interviewer.
- **Write Clean Code:** Prioritize readability and modularity.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Include edge cases and validate your solution.

### Time Management

- Allocate time blocks for different interview components.
- Balance speed and accuracy; avoid getting stuck too long on one problem.
- Use hints from interviewers and ask clarifying questions when stuck.
