# Depth First Search

Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm is used to search for a value in a tree or graph. As a traversal technique it explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

With it we go as deep as possible searching for the target value, and when we cannot find it, we retrace our steps to look for it at other places or nodes.

It uses recursive approaches including backtracking and divide-and-conquer approaches along with it.

## When to use

Use it when exploring all paths or branches in graphs or trees

## Problems
