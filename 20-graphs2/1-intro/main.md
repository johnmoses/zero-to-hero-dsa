# Introduction to Graph Algorithms II

## Introduction
This chapter builds on basic graph concepts to cover advanced topics such as connected components, cycle detection, and topological sorting.

## Details
We explore algorithms to:

- Identify connected components in graphs.  
- Detect cycles in directed and undirected graphs.  
- Perform topological sort for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

These algorithms are foundational in graph theory and essential for complex problem-solving.

## Examples
Determining if a graph has cycles helps in deadlock detection and scheduling.

## Key Concepts
- Depth-first search underlies many advanced graph algorithms.  
- Connectedness defines graph structure components.  
- Topological sort orders vertices based on dependencies.

## Summary
Mastering these advanced graph algorithms enables solving a wide range of practical and theoretical problems.
