# Connected Components

## Introduction
Connected components are maximal sets of vertices where each vertex is reachable from any other vertex in the same set.

## Details
- In undirected graphs, connected components are groups of mutually reachable vertices.  
- In directed graphs, strongly connected components have paths both ways between every pair.

DFS or BFS can be used to identify connected components efficiently.

## Examples
Finding connected components aids in network clustering and image segmentation.

## Key Concepts
- DFS explores vertices to identify components.  
- Strong connectivity is bidirectional reachability in directed graphs.  
- Components partition the graph vertices.

## Summary
Identifying connected components reveals graph structure and connectivity.
