# Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is actually a separate object and all the objects are linked together by the reference field in each element. It is an alternative data structure to array-based sequences.

It makes use of a lightweight object called node to allocate referrences to each element. It employs a couple of techniques to overcome some of the shortcomings of the sequence classes.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are many types of linked lists:

- Singly linked lists
- Doubly linked lists
- Circularly linked lists
- Multi linked lists

## Linked List operations

- Insert
- Delete
- Traverse
- Search
- Reverse

Linked lists do not have random access to elements as we see in arrays, elements are accessed through traversal. To visit `ith` element for example in a list of `n` elements, it takes `O(n)` time.

## LinkedList In-place Reversal

In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern reverses parts of a linked list without using extra space. This approach can be used to reverse sections of a linked list.

## Problems

- Merge two sorted lists (LeetCode #21, Blind)
- Merge k-sorted lists (LeetCode #23, Blind)
- Reverse Linked List (LeetCode #206, Blind, Grind)
