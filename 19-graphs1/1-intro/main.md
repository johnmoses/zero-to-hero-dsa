# Introduction to Graphs

## Introduction
Graphs are abstract data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. They model pairwise relationships.

## Details
Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and may contain cycles.

Applications include social networks, maps, recommendation systems, and scheduling.

## Examples
A social network can be modeled as a graph connecting users.

## Key Concepts
- Vertices represent entities; edges represent relationships.  
- Directed graphs have edge direction; undirected do not.  
- Graph representations include adjacency lists and matrices.

## Summary
Graphs are versatile structures that represent complex relationships and form the basis of many algorithms.
