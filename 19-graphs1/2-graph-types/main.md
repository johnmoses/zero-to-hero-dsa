# Graph Types

## Introduction
Graphs come in several types depending on directionality, weights, and cycles.

## Details
- **Directed graphs:** Edges have directions (arcs).  
- **Undirected graphs:** Edges are symmetric.  
- **Weighted graphs:** Edges carry weights or costs.  
- **Acyclic graphs:** Contain no cycles (DAGs).

Different types pose unique algorithmic challenges.

## Examples
Road maps may be weighted and directed.

## Key Concepts
- Direction affects traversal.  
- Weights influence pathfinding.  
- Cycles determine graph properties.

## Summary
Classification by type guides how graphs are used and processed.
