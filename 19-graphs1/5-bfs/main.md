# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Introduction
BFS explores a graph level-by-level using a queue, visiting all neighbors before moving to the next layer.

## Details
BFS is implemented iteratively with a queue, marking nodes as visited to prevent repetition.

It is used in shortest path algorithms in unweighted graphs, level order traversal, and graph connectivity tasks.

## Examples
Starting from a node, BFS visits all nodes at distance 1, then distance 2, and so on.

## Key Concepts
- Uses queue for FIFO order.  
- Explores neighbors before deeper nodes.  
- Useful for shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Summary
BFS systematically expands outward ensuring shortest path and layered exploration.
