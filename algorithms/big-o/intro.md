# Big O

## Cheatsheet

O(1): Constant time (super fast, doesn’t depend on input size).
O(log n): Logarithmic time (fast but slows down as input grows).
O(n): Linear time (scales directly with the input size).
O(n log n): Linearithmic time (common in sorting algorithms).
O(n²): Quadratic time (loops inside loops).
O(2^n): Exponential time (the dreaded brute force recursion).
