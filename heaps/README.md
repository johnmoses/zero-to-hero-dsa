# Heaps

A heap, or a priority queue, is a data structure that efficiently stores elements in a particular order.

Basic operations of a heap includes insertion and deletion. On insertion, if the position of the new element violates the heap properity, the new elements will be sifted up until it reaches the correct position.

By default, when we refer to heap, most implementations are min-heaps. This means the first element is always the smallest element.
