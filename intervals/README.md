# Intervals

In an interval array sorted by start time, two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] overlap if b >= c (i.e., the end time of the first interval is greater than or equal to the start time of the second interval).

## Problems

- Merge Intervals (LeetCode #56, Blind, Grind)
- Insert Interval (LeetCode #57, Blind, Grind)
- Meeting Rooms (LeetCode #252, Blind)
- Meeting Rooms II (LeetCode #253, Blind)
- Non-Overlapping Intervals (LeetCode #435, Blind)
