# Time and Space Complexity

## Introduction
Time complexity measures the duration an algorithm takes to run, while space complexity measures the memory it needs.

## Details
Analyzing both aspects helps balance speed and resource usage. Some algorithms may be faster but consume more memory, and vice versa.

It's important to know how your program behaves in different scenarios to optimize accordingly.

## Examples
A sorting algorithm may require O(n log n) time and O(n) space.

## Key Concepts
- Time complexity describes execution time growth.  
- Space complexity describes memory usage growth.  
- Trade-offs often exist between time and space.

## Summary
Understanding both complexities enables creating balanced and efficient solutions.
