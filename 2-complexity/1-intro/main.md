# Introduction to Complexity

## Introduction
Complexity analysis helps us understand how an algorithm performs as the input grows. Itâ€™s essential for writing efficient programs.

## Details
Complexity generally refers to time complexity (how run time grows) and space complexity (memory use growth). Algorithms should aim for lower complexity for scalability and speed.

We analyze complexity using Big O notation focusing mainly on worst-case scenarios to ensure reliability.

## Examples
Consider a simple search through a list: checking each item one by one leads to a linear time complexity O(n).

## Key Concepts
- Complexity measures resource usage of algorithms.  
- Time and space complexities matter most.  
- Worst-case analysis ensures performance bounds.

## Summary
Complexity analysis guides developers in algorithm design and optimization by measuring efficiency.
