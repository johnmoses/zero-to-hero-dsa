# Best, Worst, and Average Case Complexity  

## Introduction  
Algorithms often have different performance depending on the input case: best, worst, and average.

## Details  
- Best case: Minimum time taken, often trivial inputs.  
- Worst case: Maximum time taken, most difficult inputs.  
- Average case: Expected time over all inputs, usually the most realistic measure.

Analyzing all cases provides a full understanding of algorithm behavior.

## Examples  
For linear search:  
- Best: target is first element (O(1))  
- Worst: target is last or absent (O(n))  
- Average: target randomly located (O(n))

## Key Concepts  
- Worst case guarantees upper bound.  
- Best case shows ideal scenario.  
- Average case helps predict real-world use.

## Summary  
Knowing these cases helps write and choose appropriate algorithms for different scenarios.
