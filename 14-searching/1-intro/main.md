# Introduction to Searching

## Introduction
Searching algorithms locate specific elements within data structures. Efficient searching is fundamental in computer science.

## Details
Two main types of searching:

- **Linear Search:** Checks each element sequentially until found or exhausted.  
- **Binary Search:** Divides sorted data repeatedly to reduce search space.

Searching algorithms vary in approach and efficiency depending on data organization.

## Examples
Use linear search for unsorted data; binary search for sorted arrays.

## Key Concepts
- Linear search has O(n) time complexity.  
- Binary search achieves O(log n) on sorted data.  
- Data properties dictate search algorithm choice.

## Summary
Understanding searching types sets the foundation for efficient data retrieval and algorithm design.
