# Introduction to Searching

## Introduction
Searching algorithms locate specific elements within data structures. Efficient searching is fundamental in computer science. They are designed to navigate or run through data structures to find the desired data. Search algorithms are very important in databases, web search engines, and more.

## Details
Two main types of searching:

- **Linear Search:** Checks each element sequentially until found or exhausted.  
- **Binary Search:** Divides sorted data repeatedly to reduce search space.

Some of the other search algorithms are as follows:

1. Jump search
2. Interpolation Search
3. Exponential Search
4. Ternary Search
5. Fibonacci Search
6. Meta Search

## Linear Search

This is the simplest. It is also called sequential search. It works by iteratively checking each element of the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.

## Binary Search

Binary search is a highly efficient searching algorithm used for finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. It reduces the number of comparisons and thus the time complexity

## Jump Search

Jump search is an algorithm for searching in a sorted array. The basic idea is to jump ahead by fixed steps and then perform a linear search within the identified block where the target element might be located.

## Interpolation Search

Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a specific value in a sorted array. It is an improvement over binary search for uniformly distributed datasets. The basic idea of interpolation search is to estimate the position of the target value based on the values at the ends of the current search interval, thus potentially reducing the number of comparisons needed.

## Exponential Search

Exponential search is an algorithm designed for searching in a sorted array. It is particularly efficient for unbounded or infinite lists and combines binary search with an exponential growth step to find the range where the target value might exist. It is useful when the size of the list is unknown or when we want to find an element in a large sorted list efficiently.

## Ternary Search

Ternary search is an algorithm designed for searching in sorted arrays, similar to binary search. However, instead of dividing the search space in half, ternary search divides it into three parts. It is particularly efficient for finding the maximum or minimum value of a unimodal function, but it can also be used for general searching.

## Fibonacci Search

Fibonacci search is an algorithm for searching for a specific value in a sorted array. It is a modification of binary search that uses Fibonacci numbers to define the search intervals. Fibonacci search is particularly useful when the size of the array is not known in advance or when the distribution of values is uneven.

## Sentinel Linear Search

Sentinel linear search is a variation of the linear search algorithm that aims to optimize the search process by reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element. It achieves this optimization by eliminating the need for a conditional check within the loop for the target element.

## Meta Search

Meta search is a technique used in information retrieval and web searching that involves querying multiple search engines or databases simultaneously and combining the results into a single, unified list. This approach allows users to access a broader range of information sources and potentially obtain more comprehensive and relevant results compared to using a single search engine.

Searching algorithms vary in approach and efficiency depending on data organization.

## Examples
Use linear search for unsorted data; binary search for sorted arrays.

## Key Concepts
- Linear search has O(n) time complexity.  
- Binary search achieves O(log n) on sorted data.  
- Data properties dictate search algorithm choice.

## Summary
Understanding searching types sets the foundation for efficient data retrieval and algorithm design.
