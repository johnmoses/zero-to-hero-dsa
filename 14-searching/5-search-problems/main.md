# Search Problem Examples

## Introduction
This topic covers common searching problems like counting occurrences, finding kth smallest elements, and range queries using searching techniques.

## Details
Problems include:

- Count occurrence of elements in sorted arrays.  
- Find kth smallest in sorted 2D arrays.  
- Range frequency queries.

Algorithmic approaches combine binary search and data structure properties for efficiency.

## Examples
Counting ones in a sorted binary array using binary search.

## Key Concepts
- Leverage sortedness for efficient search.  
- Utilize binary search for range-based queries.  
- Solve complex queries in logarithmic time.

## Summary
Mastering search problems improves proficiency in applying searching algorithms in practical scenarios.
