# Binary Search

## Introduction
Binary search efficiently locates a target in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.

## Details
Requires sorted data. Reduces search time to O(log n).

Key steps include comparing the target with the middle element and adjusting search boundaries accordingly.

## Examples
Finding a number in a sorted list by halving search space each step.

## Key Concepts
- Divide and conquer strategy.  
- Requires sorted input.  
- Logarithmic time complexity.

## Summary
Binary search is a fundamental and highly efficient search technique for sorted data sets.
