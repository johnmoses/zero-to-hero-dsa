# Search in Rotated Arrays

## Introduction
Searching in rotated sorted arrays involves finding a target element in an array that has been sorted and then rotated.

## Details
Standard binary search modifies by identifying which half is sorted and adjusting the search space accordingly.

This approach maintains O(log n) time despite rotation.

## Examples
Finding a number in a rotated sorted array by checking sorted half boundaries.

## Key Concepts
- Identify sorted half to decide search direction.  
- Handle pivot rotations carefully.  
- Efficient search in modified arrays.

## Summary
Searching in rotated arrays extends binary search principles to handle rotations with optimal efficiency.
