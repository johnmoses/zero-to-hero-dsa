# Linear Search

## Introduction
Linear search sequentially scans each element to find a target, suitable for unsorted data.

## Details
Simple implementation with O(n) time complexity. Can be used on any list type.

Inefficient for large datasets but easy to implement.

## Examples
Searching for a number in an unsorted array.

## Key Concepts
- Checks elements one-by-one.  
- Works on unsorted data.  
- Time complexity O(n).

## Summary
Linear search is basic but versatile for small or unsorted datasets.
