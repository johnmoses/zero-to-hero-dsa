# Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

## Introduction
Deque is a generalized queue allowing insertion and deletion at both ends with efficient operations.

## Details
Used for problems requiring flexible data addition/removal from both front and back, such as sliding window problems and palindromic checks.

Deque supports all queue operations plus their reverse counterparts.

## Examples
Deque used to manage sliding window maximum efficiently.

## Key Concepts
- Supports add/remove operations on both ends.  
- Can function as stack or queue.  
- Useful in many algorithmic problems.

## Summary
Deque is a versatile data structure combining properties of stacks and queues.
