# Monotonic Stacks

## Introduction
Monotonic stacks maintain elements in increasing or decreasing order and are useful for problems like next greater element or histogram area.

## Details
Elements are pushed and popped to maintain monotonic property. This enables efficient retrievals of extrema for intervals.

Monotonic stacks are fundamental in certain range and stack-based algorithms.

## Examples
Finding the next greater element for each array element using a monotonic stack.

## Key Concepts
- Stack elements strictly increase or decrease.  
- Allows O(n) time solutions for specific problems.  
- Efficient handling of range queries.

## Summary
Monotonic stacks open efficient solutions to many array and histogram challenges.
