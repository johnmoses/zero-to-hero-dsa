# Problem Applications of Advanced Stacks and Queues

## Introduction
Advanced stacks and queues solve complex algorithmic problems, including sliding window maxima, histogram largest rectangle, and stock span.

## Details
Monotonic data structures allow processing ranges efficiently without full sorting.

Applications span diverse topics from computational geometry to finance.

## Examples
Largest rectangle in histogram using monotonic stack.

## Key Concepts
- Use monotonic structures for range extrema.  
- Solve problems in O(n) time instead of naive O(nÂ²).  
- Widely applicable in algorithmic challenges.

## Summary
Advanced stacks and queues are essential tools for optimal solutions in real-world and competitive programming problems.
