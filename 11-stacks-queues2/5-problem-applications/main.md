# Problem Applications of Advanced Stacks and Queues

## Introduction
Advanced stacks and queues solve complex algorithmic problems, including sliding window maxima, histogram largest rectangle, and stock span.

## Details
Monotonic data structures allow processing ranges efficiently without full sorting.

Applications span diverse topics from computational geometry to finance.

## Examples
Largest rectangle in histogram using monotonic stack. 

Largest Rectangle in Histogram
Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example 1:
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10

Example 2:
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

## Key Concepts
- Use monotonic structures for range extrema.  
- Solve problems in O(n) time instead of naive O(nÂ²).  
- Widely applicable in algorithmic challenges.

## Summary
Advanced stacks and queues are essential tools for optimal solutions in real-world and competitive programming problems.
