# Introduction to Advanced Stacks and Queues

## Introduction
This chapter covers advanced data structures like monotonic stacks, monotonic queues, and deques, along with practical problem applications.

## Details
- **Monotonic stacks/queues:** Maintain elements in sorted order to solve range and interval problems efficiently.
- **Deque (double-ended queue):** Allows insertion/removal from both ends.
- These structures extend capabilities beyond basic stacks and queues.

## Examples
Monotonic stack used for computing next greater elements efficiently.

## Key Concepts
- Specialized stacks/queues for optimized queries.  
- Useful in sliding window maximum/minimum problems.  
- Deques provide flexible double-ended operations.

## Summary
Advanced stacks and queues enable more efficient algorithms for complex real-world problems.
