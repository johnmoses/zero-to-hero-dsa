# Monotonic Queues

## Introduction
Monotonic queues maintain elements in a sorted order (increasing or decreasing) and support efficient sliding window maximum or minimum.

## Details
They offer O(n) solutions for sliding window problems by pushing and popping elements to maintain the queueâ€™s order.

Monotonic queues enable quick retrieval of extremal values in windows without sorting.

## Examples
Finding maximum in every sliding window of a fixed size.

## Key Concepts
- Queue maintains order for sliding windows.  
- Push new elements and pop obsolete or smaller/larger elements.  
- Efficient for range maximum/minimum problems.

## Summary
Monotonic queues solve sliding window problems efficiently using ordered queue operations.
