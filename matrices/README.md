# Matrices

Matrix or grid is a two-dimensional array arranged in rows and columns. It is commonly used to represent mathematical matrices and is fundamental in various fields like mathematics, computer graphics, and data processing. Matrices allow for efficient storage and manipulation of data in a structured format.

## Representation

The cell a[0] [0] is the first element of the first row and first column. The value in the first square bracket represents the row number and the value inside the second square bracket represents the column number. (i.e, a[row] [column]).

The rows are horizontal while columns are vertical in orientation.

## Traversal

Matrix Traversal involves traversing elements in a matrix using different techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.).

Use this pattern for problems involving traversing 2D grids or matrices horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

## Problems

- Set Matrix zeroes (LeetCode #73, Blind)
- Spiral matrix (LeetCode #54, Blind)
- Rotate Image (LeetCode #48, Blind)
- Word Search (LeetCode #79, Blind)
- Flood Fill (LeetCode #733)
- Number of Islands (LeetCode #200)
- Surrounded Regions (LeetCode #130)
