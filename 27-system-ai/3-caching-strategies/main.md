# Caching Strategies

## Introduction

Caching is a technique to store frequently accessed data closer to the client to reduce latency and improve system performance. Effective caching strategies are essential for scalable, high-performance systems.

## Details

Core caching concepts include:

- **Cache Levels:** Client-side, CDN, server-side, database caching.
- **Cache Replacement Policies:** LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), FIFO (First In First Out).
- **Cache Invalidation:** Strategies to keep cache consistent with source data, including time-based expiration and event-driven invalidation.
- **Write Policies:** Write-through, write-back, and write-around caches.
- **Distributed Caching:** Using caches like Redis or Memcached to handle scaling.

Trade-offs involve balancing cache hit rates, memory usage, and consistency.

## Examples

- Web page caching in CDNs.
- Database query caching.
- Session caching in distributed systems.

These examples demonstrate improved response times and reduced backend load.

## Key Concepts

- Data locality and temporal/spatial locality.
- Designing cache keys and value serialization.
- Handling cache misses (cold starts).
- Ensuring cache coherence in distributed environments.

## Summary

Mastering caching strategies improves system responsiveness and scalability by reducing redundant data access and offloading backend systems, a cornerstone of modern system design.
