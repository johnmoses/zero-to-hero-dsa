# System Design Basics

## Introduction

System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and reliable software systems.

## Details

Key aspects of system design include:

- **Scalability:** Designing systems that handle growth in users and data.
- **Reliability:** Ensuring systems behave correctly and recover from failures.
- **Maintainability:** Structuring the system for easy updates and testing.
- **Performance:** Optimizing for speed and resource efficiency.
- **Components:** Understanding clients, servers, databases, load balancers, proxies, and caches.

Design methodologies involve trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

## Examples

- Designing a URL shortener service.
- Building a scalable messaging system.
- Architecting a content delivery network (CDN).

These examples highlight considerations like data partitioning, caching, and system bottlenecks.

## Key Concepts

- Microservices vs Monolithic Architectures.
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling.
- Data sharding and replication.
- Consistency models: eventual vs strong consistency.
- Caching layers and cache invalidation strategies.

## Summary

Mastering system design basics enables architects to build robust systems that can grow and adapt to ever-increasing demands, balancing multiple constraints effectively.
