# Database Fundamentals

## Introduction

Databases are structured systems for storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. Understanding database fundamentals is critical for designing persistent and scalable applications.

## Details

Key topics include:

- **Database Models:** Relational databases using SQL, and NoSQL databases such as document stores, key-value stores, and wide-column stores.
- **Transactions:** Principles of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).
- **Indexing:** Techniques to speed up data retrieval.
- **Normalization:** Organizing data to reduce redundancy.
- **Query Processing:** How databases parse, optimize, and execute queries.
- **Scaling:** Vertical and horizontal scaling, replication, and sharding to handle large datasets.

## Examples

- Designing a simple relational schema for a user system.
- Using secondary indexes for fast lookups.
- Examples of NoSQL models like MongoDB documents or Redis key-value pairs.

## Key Concepts

- Trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).
- Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Query optimization strategies.
- Backup and recovery mechanisms.

## Summary

A strong grasp of database fundamentals enables building systems that handle data reliably and efficiently, forming the backbone of most modern applications.
