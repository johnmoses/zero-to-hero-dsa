# Core Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML) algorithms enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This topic introduces core ML algorithms fundamental to many applications.

## Details

Key ML algorithms covered:

- **Supervised Learning:** Algorithms trained on labeled data.
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Algorithms identifying patterns without labels.
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Neural Networks:** Foundations of deep learning for complex tasks.

Concepts include training, evaluation metrics, overfitting, and model selection.

## Examples

- Predicting continuous values with linear regression.
- Classifying emails as spam or not with logistic regression.
- Clustering customers using k-means.
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA.

## Key Concepts

- Model hypothesis and parameter estimation.
- Loss functions and optimization.
- Bias-variance trade-off.
- Regularization techniques.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Summary

Understanding core ML algorithms provides the foundation to build, evaluate, and improve models that learn from data to solve real-world problems.
