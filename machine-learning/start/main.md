# Getting started with Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning gives the computer the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. The algorithm takes in a collection of data called dataset which can be array or any data type. It analyses the data and learns to produce the outcome called prediction.

Machine learning uses many functions in math, statistics, probability and advanced math to carry out data analysis and prdections.

We will start with a simple linear regression problem in order to have a good understanding of machine learning algorithms.

## Linear regression

Regression is used to find the relationship that exists between variables. Linear regression uses the relationship between the data points to draw a line to predict future values.
