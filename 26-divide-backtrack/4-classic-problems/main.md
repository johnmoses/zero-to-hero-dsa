# Classic Divide and Conquer Problems

## Introduction

This topic explores well-known classic problems effectively solved by divide and conquer strategies. These problems illustrate practical applications of the paradigm and demonstrate common patterns.

## Details

Classic problems include:

- **Binary Search:** Searching a sorted array in logarithmic time by dividing the search space.
- **Merge Sort:** Efficient sorting via recursive splitting and merging.
- **Quick Sort:** Sorting by partitioning around a pivot.
- **Closest Pair of Points:** Finding the closest pair in a set of points using recursive spatial partitioning.
- **Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication:** A faster matrix multiplication algorithm using divide and conquer.

Studying these problems aids in understanding the design and analysis of divide and conquer algorithms.

## Examples

- Binary Search on sorted arrays.
- Merge Sort and Quick Sort for sorting.
- Divide and conquer approach to closest points.
- Applications in computational geometry and numerical methods.

## Key Concepts

- Recursion and problem reduction.
- Balancing subproblems for optimal performance.
- Efficient combining of subproblem solutions.
- Trade-offs in pivot selection and partitioning.

## Summary

Classic divide and conquer problems form the foundation of many algorithms across domains. Mastery of these problems equips you to identify and implement efficient recursive solutions.
