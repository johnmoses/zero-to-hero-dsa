# Constraint Satisfaction

## Introduction

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are mathematical problems defined by a set of variables, domains for each variable, and constraints specifying allowable combinations of values. Solving CSPs involves finding values for all variables that satisfy all constraints.

## Details

CSPs are prevalent in scheduling, resource allocation, and puzzle solving. Backtracking combined with constraint propagation techniques is commonly used to solve CSPs efficiently.

Key techniques include:

- **Backtracking Search:** Systematically exploring assignments and pruning inconsistent ones.
- **Forward Checking:** Preventing future conflicts by checking domains ahead.
- **Constraint Propagation:** Enforcing local consistency to reduce domains.
- **Heuristics:** Variable and value ordering to guide search.

## Examples

Typical CSPs:

- Sudoku puzzles.
- Map coloring.
- N-Queens as CSP.
- Job scheduling.

Effective CSP solutions leverage pruning and heuristics to navigate large search spaces.

## Key Concepts

- Variables, Domains, Constraints.
- Search with pruning and consistency checks.
- Importance of heuristics for tractability.
- CSP as a framework for various combinatorial problems.

## Summary

Constraint Satisfaction formalizes a broad class of problems solved with backtracking and constraint propagation. Understanding CSP techniques is critical to designing efficient algorithms for complex, real-world problems involving constraints.
