# Divide and Conquer

## Introduction

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

## Details

The approach involves three main steps:

1. **Divide:** Split the problem into several subproblems of the same type but smaller size.
2. **Conquer:** Recursively solve these subproblems.
3. **Combine:** Merge the solutions of the subproblems to obtain the solution for the original problem.

Divide and Conquer is effective for problems that can be broken down recursively and combined efficiently, often leading to algorithms with logarithmic or near-linear complexities.

## Examples

Common algorithms using divide and conquer:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Closest Pair of Points

These examples demonstrate efficient sorting, searching, and geometric computations.

## Key Concepts

- Problem decomposition into recursive subproblems.
- Base case for stopping recursion.
- Combining results efficiently.
- Master theorem for analyzing time complexity.

## Summary

Divide and Conquer reduces complex problems into manageable parts that are solved recursively and combined. It forms the foundation of many efficient algorithms critical in computer science.
