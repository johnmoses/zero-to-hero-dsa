# Introduction to Divide and Conquer and Backtracking

## Introduction

This chapter introduces two fundamental algorithmic paradigms: Divide and Conquer and Backtracking. Both are powerful techniques used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems or exploring solution spaces systematically.

## Details

- **Divide and Conquer** splits a problem into smaller independent subproblems, solves each recursively, and combines their results. This paradigm underlies many efficient algorithms like mergesort and quicksort.
  
- **Backtracking** explores all potential solutions by constructing candidates incrementally and abandoning partial candidates that cannot lead to a valid solution (pruning). It is often used for constraint satisfaction problems.

The chapter covers theoretical foundations, common problem patterns, and classic examples illustrating these approaches.

## Examples

- Divide and Conquer: Merge Sort, Binary Search.
- Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum.

## Key Concepts

- Problem decomposition and recursive strategies.
- Pruning search space to improve efficiency.
- Master theorem for analyzing recursive algorithm complexity.
- Handling constraints systematically in search.

## Summary

Understanding Divide and Conquer alongside Backtracking equips you with versatile techniques for algorithm designâ€”enabling efficient solutions to sorting, searching, combinatorial, and constraint-based problems.
