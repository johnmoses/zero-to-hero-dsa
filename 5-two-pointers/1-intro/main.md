# Introduction to Two Pointers

## Introduction
The two pointers technique uses two indices to traverse a data structure, often an array or string, to solve problems efficiently.

## Details
Two pointers can move at different speeds or directions to find subarrays, pairs, or partitions. This technique reduces the need for nested loops, improving time complexity.

Applications include searching pairs with a sum, reversing arrays, and detecting cycles in linked lists.

## Examples
Using two pointers on a sorted array to find pairs summing to a target.

## Key Concepts
- Employs two indices traversing the data structure.  
- Can move pointers towards each other or at different strides.  
- Improves efficiency by reducing time complexity.

## Summary
The two pointers technique is a powerful and versatile method for solving array and string problems efficiently.
