# Common Two Pointers Problems

## Introduction
This topic reviews classic problems solved efficiently using the two pointers technique and sliding windows.

## Details
Problems include:

- Pair with target sum in a sorted array.  
- Remove duplicates from sorted array.  
- Maximum sum subarray of fixed size.  
- Minimum size subarray sum.  
- Container with most water.

Learning these common problems solidifies understanding and application of two pointers.

## Examples
Maximum water container problem: using two pointers from ends towards center.

## Key Concepts
- Many array and string problems fit two pointers.  
- Efficient alternative to brute force nested loops.  
- Practice improves pattern recognition.

## Summary
Mastering common two pointers problems builds strong problem-solving skills and coding efficiency.
