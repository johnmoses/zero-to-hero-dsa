# The Two Pointers Technique

## Introduction
The two pointers technique involves using two indices to scan a data structure in a coordinated way, commonly for sorting or searching problems.

## Details
Pointers can start at the beginning and end and move towards each other, or both can move forward at different speeds.

Common use cases are finding pairs, removing duplicates, merging sorted arrays, and sliding window problems.

The technique can drastically reduce time complexity compared to brute force.

## Examples
Finding pairs in a sorted array that sum to a specific value.

## Key Concepts
- Two pointers move through data, often in opposite directions.  
- Efficient for sorted data.  
- Can be adapted for sliding windows and partitions.

## Summary
Mastering the two pointers technique optimizes solutions for many array and string problems, making code cleaner and faster.
