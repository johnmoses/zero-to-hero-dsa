# Introduction to Trees

## Introduction
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a designated root node and child-parent relationships.

## Details
Trees are widely used to represent hierarchical data like file systems, organizational charts, and abstract syntax.

A binary tree is a specialized tree where each node has at most two children: left and right.

## Examples
Binary trees are common in searching and sorting algorithms like binary search trees and heaps.

## Key Concepts
- Node: An item stored in the tree
- Root: The topmost node that has no parent
- Child: A node immediately below and directly connected to a given node
- Parent: A node immediately above and directly connected to a given node
- Siblings: The children of a common parent
- Leaf: A node that has no children
- Interior node: A node that has at least one child
- Edge/Branch/Link: The line that connects a parent to the child
- Descendant: All the node's children down to the leaves
- Ancestor: A node's parent up to the root
- Path: The sequence of edges that connects a node with one of its descendants
- Path Length: The number of edges in a path
- Depth or Level: The length of the path connecting the root
- Height: The length of the longest path
- Subtree: A tree formed from viewpoint of a node and all its descendants

## Summary
Trees provide powerful models for hierarchical data and underpin many algorithms.
