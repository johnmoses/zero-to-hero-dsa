# Introduction to Trees

## Introduction
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a designated root node and child-parent relationships.

## Details
Trees are widely used to represent hierarchical data like file systems, organizational charts, and abstract syntax.

A binary tree is a specialized tree where each node has at most two children: left and right.

## Examples
Binary trees are common in searching and sorting algorithms like binary search trees and heaps.

## Key Concepts
- Root node is the top.  
- Nodes linked via parent-child edges.  
- Recursive nature with subtrees.

## Summary
Trees provide powerful models for hierarchical data and underpin many algorithms.
