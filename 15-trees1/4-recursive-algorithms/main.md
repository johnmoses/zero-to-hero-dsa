# Recursive Algorithms on Trees

## Introduction
Recursion naturally models tree problems, processing nodes and their subtrees systematically.

## Details
Common recursive tree algorithms include searching, insertion, deletion, traversals, and computing tree properties like height and size.

Understanding recursion is key to efficient tree algorithm implementation.

## Examples
Computing the height of a binary tree recursively.

## Key Concepts
- Divide problem into subproblems on subtrees.  
- Recursive base cases when nodes are null.  
- Often accompanies traversal algorithms.

## Summary
Recursive algorithms harness tree structure for elegant and efficient solutions.
