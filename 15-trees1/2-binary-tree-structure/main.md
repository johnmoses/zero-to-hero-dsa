# Binary Tree Structure

## Introduction
A binary tree consists of nodes each containing data and two child pointers: left and right.

## Details
Nodes may have zero, one, or two children. 

Common types include full, complete, and perfect binary trees.

## Examples
A full binary tree has all nodes with zero or two children.

## Key Concepts
- Each node has at most two children.  
- Useful for efficient searching and sorting.  
- Basis for more complex trees like BST.

## Summary
Understanding binary tree structure is foundational for tree-based algorithms.
