# Tree Traversals

## Introduction
Tree traversals systematically visit all nodes. Common traversal orders include pre-order, in-order, post-order and level-order.

## Details
- **Pre-order:** Root, left, right  
- **In-order:** Left, root, right  
- **Post-order:** Left, right, root  
- **Level-order:** Breadth-first traversal visiting nodes level by level.

Traversals enable various tree algorithms like expression evaluation and tree copying.

## Examples
In-order traversal of a binary search tree results in sorted keys.

## Key Concepts
- Recursion and queues used in traversal.  
- Each traversal serves different purposes.

## Summary
Mastery of traversal techniques is essential for tree algorithm applications.
