# Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search algorithm is a traversal technique that explores nodes level by level in a tree or graph.

It works by first visiting all nodes in a level before visiting other nodes in the next level. It makes use of a queue (First In First Out) to deque a node and enqueue it's children.

## When to use

Use this when finding the shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order traversal in trees

## Problems

Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (LeetCode #102)
Rotting Oranges (LeetCode #994)
Word Ladder (LeetCode #127)
