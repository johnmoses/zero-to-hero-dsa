# Heaps

A heap, or a priority queue, is a data structure that efficiently stores elements in a particular order.

Basic operations of a heap includes insertion and deletion. On insertion, if the position of the new element violates the heap properity, the new elements will be sifted up until it reaches the correct position.

By default, when we refer to heap, most implementations are min-heaps. This means the first element is always the smallest element.

## Top ‘K’ Elements

The Top ‘K’ Elements pattern finds the top k largest or smallest elements in an array or stream of data using heaps or sorting.

## Problems

Kth Largest Element in an Array (LeetCode #215)
Top K Frequent Elements (LeetCode #347)
Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums (LeetCode #373)
