# Trie Structure

## Introduction
A Trie (prefix tree) stores strings as paths from root to nodes, enabling efficient prefix queries.

## Details
Each node represents a character; words correspond to paths ending at marked nodes.

Tries support insert, search, and prefix matching in O(m) time (m = key length).

## Examples
Inserting and searching for words in a trie.

## Key Concepts
- Nodes contain children maps and end-of-word markers.  
- Fast prefix-based search.  
- Suitable for dictionaries and autocomplete.

## Summary
Tries facilitate efficient string retrieval by shared prefix representation.
