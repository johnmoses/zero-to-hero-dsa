# Tree Serialization

## Introduction
Tree serialization converts a tree structure into a string or byte stream for storage or transmission.

## Details
Key methods include:

- **Pre-order traversal with null markers:** Encode tree preserving structure.  
- **Level-order traversal:** Serialize level by level including null placeholders.

Deserialization reconstructs the tree from the serialized data.

## Examples
Serializing a binary tree to a string for easy saving and loading.

## Key Concepts
- Preserving structural information is essential.  
- Null markers handle missing children.  
- Enables tree persistence and network transfer.

## Summary
Tree serialization and deserialization allow tree data structures to be saved and restored efficiently.
