# Introduction to Advanced Tree Structures

## Introduction
This chapter explores advanced tree types including Tries, tree serialization techniques, and n-ary trees.

## Details
- **Trie:** Efficient prefix tree for string retrieval.  
- **Tree Serialization:** Encoding tree structure for storage or transmission.  
- **N-ary Trees:** Generalization of binary trees where nodes can have variable number of children.

These data structures and methods enable efficient representation and querying of complex hierarchical data.

## Examples
Tries support fast prefix search for dictionaries and autocomplete.

## Key Concepts
- Specialized tree structures for optimized tasks.  
- Serialization enables persistent storage and network transfer.  
- N-ary trees model more complex hierarchies than binary trees.

## Summary
Mastering advanced tree types expands capabilities in data organization and algorithm design.
