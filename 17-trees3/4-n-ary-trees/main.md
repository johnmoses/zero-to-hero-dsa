# N-ary Trees

## Introduction
N-ary trees are tree data structures where each node can have up to N children, generalizing binary trees that have at most two children.

## Details
Each node contains a value and a list (or vector) of child nodes. This allows flexible and hierarchical representations suitable for complex data like organizational charts, file systems, and game trees.

Common operations include inserting nodes, traversing the tree (level-order, preorder etc.), and searching.

## Examples
An N-ary tree node might have three children, unlike binary trees with only two.

Level-order traversal visits nodes breadth-first, processing all nodes at each level before descending.

## Key Concepts
- Nodes contain multiple children stored in dynamic arrays or linked lists.  
- Traverse using queues for BFS or recursion for DFS.  
- N-ary trees model hierarchical data beyond binary trees.

## Summary
N-ary trees extend the concept of trees to allow multiple children per node, enabling richer data modeling and application.
