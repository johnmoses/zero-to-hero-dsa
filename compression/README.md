# Compression

What is compression?

A compression algorithm is a method used to reduce the size of data files by encoding information more efficiently. It achieves this by removing redundancies or less important data, making storage and transmission more efficient. Compression algorithms can be classified into two types:

 1. Lossless Compression: Preserves all original data, allowing the exact reconstruction of the original file (e.g., ZIP, PNG, Huffman coding).

 2. Lossy Compression: Reduces file size by discarding some non-essential data, which may result in a loss of quality (e.g., JPEG for images, MP3 for audio).
