# Sorting

Sorting is the rearrangement of elements in a collection based on a common characteristic in a specified order or to produce a new copy of the collection or sequence. Sorting is often associated with comparison.

A sort is formally defined as a rearrangement of a sequence of elements that puts all elements into a non-decreasing order based on the ordering relation on the elements.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is an algorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value.

## Selection Sort

The Selection Sort algorithm finds the lowest value in an array and moves it to the front of the array.

## Insertion Sort

The Insertion Sort algorithm uses one part of the array to hold the sorted values, and the other part of the array to hold values that are not sorted yet.

## Quick Sort

The Quicksort algorithm takes an array of values, chooses one of the values as the 'pivot' element, and moves the other values so that lower values are on the left of the pivot element, and higher values are on the right of it

## Radix Sort

The Radix Sort algorithm sorts an array by individual digits, starting with the least significant digit (the rightmost one).

## Heap Sort

## Merge Sort

## Bucket Sort

## Topological Sort

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u-v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
