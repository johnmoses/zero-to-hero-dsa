# Common Hashing Problems

## Introduction
This topic covers classical problems efficiently solved using hashing, including frequency counting, anagrams, intersection, and two-sum variants.

## Details
Hashing allows fast lookups, enabling O(n) solutions where brute force may be O(nÂ²).

Common problems include:

- Counting frequencies of elements.  
- Finding if two strings are anagrams.  
- Intersection of arrays.  
- Two-sum problem on arrays.

Understanding these problems builds strong algorithmic skills using hash-based data structures.

## Examples
Finding if two strings are anagrams by comparing character frequency maps.

## Key Concepts
- Use hash maps or hash sets for counting and membership queries.  
- Trade space for time efficiency.  
- Handle collisions and data structure limitations carefully.

## Summary
Mastery of common hashing problems improves problem-solving speed and algorithm design.
