# Hash Functions

## Introduction
Hash functions deterministically convert data (keys) into hash codes used to index hash tables.

## Details
A good hash function is fast to compute, uniformly distributes keys, and minimizes collisions.

Common hash functions include modular arithmetic, multiplicative hash, and cryptographic hashes.

## Examples
Simple modulo hash to map integer keys.

## Key Concepts
- Determinism: same input yields same hash code.  
- Uniform distribution avoids clustering.  
- Minimized collisions improve performance.

## Summary
Hash function design is crucial for the efficiency and reliability of hashing-based data structures.
