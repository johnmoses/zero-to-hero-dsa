# Introduction to Hashing

## Introduction
Hashing is a technique that maps data to fixed-size values (hash codes), enabling efficient data retrieval.

## Details
Hash functions convert keys into indices in hash tables, supporting near O(1) average time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

Good hashing minimizes collisions, which occur when multiple keys map to the same index.

## Examples
Storing user credentials in a hash map for fast access.

## Key Concepts
- Hash functions convert keys to indices.  
- Collision handling essential for correctness.  
- Hash tables provide fast average lookup.

## Summary
Hashing is fundamental for efficient data storage and retrieval across computer science.
