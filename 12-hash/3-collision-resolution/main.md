# Collision Resolution

## Introduction
Collisions occur when multiple keys hash to the same index. Collision resolution strategies ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval.

## Details
Common methods:

- **Chaining:** Store colliding elements in linked lists at the bucket.  
- **Open addressing:** Probe for next available slot using linear or quadratic probing, or double hashing.

Good collision resolution minimizes performance degradation.

## Examples
Hash map using chaining to manage collisions.

## Key Concepts
- Chaining uses linked data structures per bucket.  
- Open addressing searches for free slots.  
- Both maintain average constant-time operations.

## Summary
Effective collision resolution is vital for reliable and fast hash table operations.
