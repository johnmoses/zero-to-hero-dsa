# Binary

Bitwise algorithms refer to the use of bitwise operators to manipulate individual bits of data. Python provides a set of bitwise operators such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), NAND (~&), NOR (~|), and shift left (<<), and shift right (>>).

Specifically, XOR has interesting properties that allow you to find a missing number in a list or add up 2 numbers without using the addition or subtraction operation.

These operators are commonly used in tasks like encryption, compression, graphics, communications over ports and sockets, embedded systems programming, and more

A good example is manipulation of bits to detect errors (hamming code), encrypt and decrypt messages (more on that in the 'ciphers' folder) or just do anything at the lowest level of your computer
